## Goal:
This app will allow the user to quickly decode/encode objects in morse code.


## Technologies
### This project utilizes:
-C++ <br />
-Binary Trees and Maps


### Summary:
- The project uses an external text file that includes every character in the alphabet followed by its corresponding morse code value <br />
- The app will be able to use an encode method to convert a string from it's alphabetic representation to it's morse code equivalent. This encode method will use a map to quickly access the morse code value of the letter that is assigned as it's "key" <br />



### TODO:
- Write an insert method that builds the binary tree from the text file <br />
- Create a method that decodes a word of morse code values and returns it's alphabetic equivalence
